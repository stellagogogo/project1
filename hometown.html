The people of Yong'an combined the local bamboo shoot processing methods with it, and first invented and created the earliest prototype of processing technology for Min bamboo shoots. Min bamboo shoots are refined using traditional techniques such as shell removal, steaming, pressing, drying, and shaping, and are refined using scientific methods. After soaking and cooking, various dishes with refreshing and delicious taste can be made. </p>
